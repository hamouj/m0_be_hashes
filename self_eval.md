# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled with including all of the items in my hashes. I often forgot the comma after the key-values when creating my hashes and would sometimes forget the equal sign after the hash name and before the open curly brace.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I like to take notes in my notebook. I often try to organize my notes on a new topic by dividing it into sections: Vocabulary & definitions, examples (with labels), things to note. I find this is super helpful when referencing my notes as I can go to the section that matches my need.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try to solve the problem using code and then try reading and interpreting the error message. After 2-3 attempts of updating the code, refrencing my notes, and trying to interpret the error message, I then turn to Google for help. When Googling, I try to use the following format: data type, what I'm trying to do, language (i.e. hashes print ruby).
